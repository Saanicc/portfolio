This is the code behind my personal portfolio website that showcases my work experience, personal projects, skills, and a form to contact me. 
It's built with Next.js, Tailwind CSS, animations are handled with GSAP and the contact form is handled with EmailJS. 
The website is hosted on Vercel with GitHub integration for continuous deployment.

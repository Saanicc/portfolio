            Hello! I&apos;m Mattias, a passionate developer focused on creating
            beautiful and functional web experiences. With a background in
            frontend development, I bring creativity and technical expertise to
            every project.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I&apos;m not coding, you can find me playing video games or
            exploring new technologies when time allows. I believe in continuous
            learning and staying up-to-date with the latest technologies and
            industry trends.
